        #LOC_KPBS.agency.desc = Um recém-chegado no negócio espacial. Depois de girar o ramo da caravana, esta agência agora se concentra completamente em viagens espaciais e habitats planetários extras. Seus jovens CEOs querem que a Kerman & Kerman se empenhe pela posição de líder de mercado. Isso às vezes incentiva os engenheiros a serem um pouco precipitados e, ocasionalmente, causar acidentes. Ainda assim, eles estão tentando ter uma boa reputação de moralidade e segurança.
